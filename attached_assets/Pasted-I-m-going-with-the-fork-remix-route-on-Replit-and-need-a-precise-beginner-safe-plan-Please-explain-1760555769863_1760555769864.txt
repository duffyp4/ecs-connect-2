I’m going with the fork/remix route on Replit and need a precise, beginner‑safe plan. Please explain:

1) What exactly gets copied in a fork vs. what does NOT:
- Included: source code, repo files, package manifests, config files (.replit, replit.nix), file‑based assets in the repo.
- Not included: existing Replit Database data, Secrets/Environment variables stored in Replit’s UI, Deployments, custom domains/DNS records, logs/metrics, scheduled tasks, webhooks/OAuth provider settings.

2) How to stand up a fresh Replit Database in the target (client) fork without losing functionality:
- Describe the minimum initialization logic my app should run on first start when the DB is empty (e.g., create default config keys, bootstrap roles/permissions, create an initial admin account, seed sample content if needed).
- Show how the app should safely handle “missing data” reads by using defaults or by creating required records on demand.
- Clarify any differences between build‑time vs runtime initialization and where to put each.

3) Step‑by‑step execution checklist for the fork route:
- Prep: list all required env vars/secrets and where they should be set in the client fork; call out that UI‑stored secrets do not copy.
- Fork/remix and install dependencies; verify the app boots locally with an empty DB.
- Configure env vars/secrets in the client fork; rotate any sensitive keys.
- Deploy the client fork; validate health endpoints.
- Attach the custom domain to the client app; update DNS records to the new target; verify TLS.
- Update third‑party integrations: webhooks, OAuth callback/redirect URLs, email providers, payment gateways; run test events (expect 2xx) and validate signatures.
- Smoke test critical paths: sign‑up/login, payments, emails, file uploads, admin flows.

4) Common pitfalls for beginners and how to avoid them:
- Missing env vars/secrets after fork (app crashes).
- Assuming data exists (null/undefined reads; fix with defaults/initialization).
- Forgetting to detach/reassign custom domain and update DNS.
- Not updating webhook endpoints or OAuth redirect URIs.
- Skipping dependency install or build steps.

5) Final validation checklist:
- Functional parity: all user journeys pass.
- Data model: required keys/collections exist; no missing indexes/permissions.
- Security: secrets rotated; least‑privilege roles; old app archived/deleted.
- Operations: logs/monitoring/alerts configured; backups enabled.

Provide the answer in clear numbered steps, call out concrete places in the Replit UI (e.g., where to set Secrets/env vars), and include simple pseudocode or short language‑agnostic examples for empty‑DB initialization and “missing value” handling. Keep it beginner‑friendly and actionable.
